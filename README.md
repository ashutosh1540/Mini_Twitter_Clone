# Mini_Twitter_Clone
Introduction
This set of notes provides an overview of creating a mini Twitter clone using Angular.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. This project will cover essential concepts for building a basic social media platform, including user registration, posting tweets, following other users, and displaying a feed.

Technologies Used
Angular.js: A JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications.
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used to create the backend server.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing user data, tweets, and other information.

Project Structure
Backend (Node.js):
Server Setup: Set up an Express.js server to handle HTTP requests.
User Authentication: Implement user registration and login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
Database: Connect to a MongoDB database to store user data and tweets.
User Model: Define a user schema and model using Mongoose.
Tweet Model: Define a tweet schema and model using Mongoose.
Routes: Create API routes for user registration, login, creating tweets, following users, and fetching user timelines.
Middleware: Implement middleware for authentication and error handling.
Controller: Write controller functions to handle various API endpoints.
JWT: Utilize JSON Web Tokens to secure routes and authenticate users.
Socket.io (optional): Implement real-time updates for tweets and notifications using WebSockets.

Frontend (Angular.js):
Angular App Setup: Set up an Angular.js application structure.
Components: Create reusable Angular components for the UI, including user registration, login, tweeting, user profile, and tweet feed.
Routing: Implement client-side routing using Angular Router to navigate between different pages.
Services: Create services to handle API requests to the backend server for user authentication, posting tweets, following users, and fetching data.
Authentication: Manage user authentication state, store JWT tokens in local storage or cookies, and handle user sessions.
Real-Time Updates (optional): Use a library like Socket.io to display real-time tweets and notifications.
Forms: Build forms for user registration and tweet posting with validation.
User Interface: Design a responsive and user-friendly interface for the application.
